My favorite extensions for AF SDK applications.

I'm Rick Davin.  I am an employee for OSIsoft, LLC.  I enjoy developing applications using OSIsoft technologies, particulary using C# and AF SDK whether its for an Asset server or a PI Server aka Data Archive.

It's important to state that this is not THE PI Developer's Club Library.  Rather it is my personal library for applications that I may promote over at PI Developer's Club on OSIsoft's PI Square community forums.  See https://pisquare.osisoft.com/community/developers-club for more.

Oct 2016, this library consists mostly of extension methods, with the lone exception of a sortable binding list whenever I worked with a data grid view in a Windows Form.

The AF based extension methods revolve around 3 different areas:

1) Time, be it AFTime, DateTime, or time spans.
2) Data, a few simple summary methods fetching PI data.
3) Asset, a few methods for working with AFAttributes and AFAttributeTemplates.
